# Pending for [capataz-inveniemus](https://github.com/LeonardoVal/capataz-inveniemus.js).

## General

+ Implement a coevaluation scheme (`distributeCoevaluation`) to support schemes like coevolution.

+ Extend `distributeEvaluation` to take many metaheuristics, running them in sequence or parallel.

+ Function `distributeRuns` to distribute many metaheuristic runs. It may be based on a
function that creates a metaheuristic for a given problem, or a set of parameter variants. It would
be best probably to send entire steps to the clients.

## Development

+ Move to `@creatartis` scope.

+ Automated testing.
